MatLab functions and scripts for processing raw MED X-ray diffraction files (Tailored to X17B2 and 6-BM-B)

This repository contains various MatLab functions and scripts I have developed to deal with the raw diffraction data from high pressure experiments at X17B2 of the NSLS (R.I.P.) and 6-BM-B of the APS.

Comments and suggestions welcome, but this is my first time, so be gentle.
